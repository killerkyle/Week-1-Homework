# Week-1-Homework
I am still learning and figuring out the different ways to go about styling and labeling (HTML) to really maximize fixing someones code.
I made some small adjustments to the HTML. One was from a class to an ID because its identifying something that isnt used anywhere else.
I changed to footer tag size to an h3. This font size seemed like it fit the page much cleaner.
The CSS was me playing around with some positions and how things interacted when making the brpwser smaller and bigger. seeing how each class is referenced and how you can style 2 things within the same CSS tag.
The sidebar is pretty weird once the browser scrolls in and smaller. It pushes everything down in a really ugly fashion.
